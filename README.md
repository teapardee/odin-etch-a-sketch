Throughout this project I learned & practiced the following:

- DOM manipulation using loop
- Mouseover Event Listener
- CSS Grid
- Recursive functions
- Parsing Prompt Responses

I spent the majority of my time learning CSS Grid and figuring out the best way to parse the user's prompt input. This lesson reinforced the importance of planning the layout, justify & align content/items, commit messages & keeping files organized with comments.
